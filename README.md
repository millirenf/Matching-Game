## Instructions

Game Objective: To match all 8 pairs of cards in as few moves as possible (2 cards flipped up constitutes a move) and in as short a time as possible.

Game Play: Simple click on 2 cards, if the icons match the cards will stay flipped over, if not, the cards will turn back face down.

After the Game: Once you win the game, there will be a pop up box displaying your final move count, game play time, and star rating. You can either just close the box or hit 'Replay" to go again!

If you want to start over in the middle of a game, simply click the restart icon (the circular arrow)!


## Contributing

This game was built using the starter code from Udacity.com as part of their Front End Web Development Nanodegree.  

From there I added code to complete the game.
